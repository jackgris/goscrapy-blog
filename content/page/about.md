My name is `Gabriel Pozo`. I've been a software developer for some time.

I start doing some work with Python 2.6 in 2008 and developing Android apps with Java 1.6 (when Android Studio didn't exist) for the Android 2.2 version. It's been some time since that and I hope my experience be useful for anyone who needs it.

- I work with Go and Python.
- I do some things with React.

If you want can write me an `Email` or send me a DM on `Twitter`.

### And remenber these:

- Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
